Title: Feature Extraction from Biological Sequences
Version: 1.1.1
Author: Sare Amerifar
Maintainer: Sare Amerifar <sare.ameri.01@gmail.com>
Description: Extracts features from biological sequences. It contains most features which are presented in related work and also includes features which have never been introduced before. It extracts numerous features from Nucleotide and Peptide sequences. Each feature converts the input sequences to discrete numbers in order to use them as predictors in machine learning models. There are many features and information which are hidden inside a sequence. Utilizing the package, users can convert biological sequences to discrete models based on chosen properties.
