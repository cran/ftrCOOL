\usage{
LocalPoSpKaaF(seqs, k = 2, label = c(), outFormat = "mat", outputFileDist = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{seqs}{is a FASTA file with amino acid sequences. Each sequence starts
with a '>' character. Also, seqs could be a string vector. Each element of the vector is a peptide/protein sequence.}

\item{k}{is a numeric value which holds the value of k in the k-mers.}

\item{label}{is an optional parameter. It is a vector whose length is equivalent to the number of sequences. It shows the class of
each entry (i.e., sequence).}

\item{outFormat}{(output format) can take two values: 'mat'(matrix) and 'txt'. The default value is 'mat'.}

\item{outputFileDist}{shows the path and name of the 'txt' output file.}
}
\value{
The output depends on the outFormat parameter which can be either 'mat' or 'txt'. If outFormat is 'mat', the function returns a feature
matrix for sequences with the same length such that the number of columns is (sequence length-k+1)
and the number of rows is equal to the number of sequences. It is usable for machine learning purposes.
If the outFormat is 'txt', the output is written to a tab-delimited file.
}
\description{
For each sequence, this function creates a feature vector denoted as
(f1,f2, f3, â€¦, fN), where fi = freq(i'th k-mer of the sequence) / i.
It should be applied to sequences with the same length.
